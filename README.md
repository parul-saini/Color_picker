At the early stages of my journey into web development, I undertook a Color Picker project to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aimed to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to select and visualize colors effortlessly. Leveraging HTML for structuring the elements, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality, I implemented a color palette with an intuitive user interface.
The primary goal is to allow users to select colors visually according to RGB values display on screen.

The Color Picker project facilitated my understanding of event handling, DOM manipulation, and the use of various CSS styles to enhance the visual appeal. Through this hands-on experience, I gained proficiency in managing user interactions, dynamically updating the UI, and creating a responsive design that adapts to different devices.

This project not only provided hands-on experience in structuring HTML documents, styling with CSS, and implementing interactivity with JavaScript but also allowed me to grasp the importance of user experience in web development. As a foundational project, the color picker served as an excellent introduction to these technologies, paving the way for more complex projects in my learning journey.

Overall, the Color Picker project served as a valuable stepping stone in my learning journey, providing practical insights into the application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating interactive and visually appealing web applications.<img width="960" alt="colorpicker" src="https://github.com/parul-saini/Color_picker/assets/97037135/d6713a09-79bd-45c3-9ff8-f2b9e8313bf1">
